            Becoming <em style="background-color: #1a89171a;">a computer programmer</em> 
             would be great because there are many options in this career by having the ability to
              produce an operating system,<br>
             or a game for the world. Computer programmers have many opportunities in life to find 
             a job they would love. Programmers can work independently,<br> 
             or in a big company. Programmers have and are creating the future for computers.

Computer programmers have a wide range on what they can do.<br> Computer programmers write the 
detailed list of instructions the computer will follow in the software (Great Sample Resume). 
This is also called ‚Äúcoding.‚Äù<br>
 Programmers test their software, or other peoples, to see if it works properly (Career Cruising)
 . Programmers study the tasks that the program will‚Ä¶<br>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The programmer will either have to go to the business or the home in some sort of transportation
             or by using his own computer. If the programmer is working <br>on certain software for his clients,
              then he may have built it in a way to assist them from his computer.

            <em style="background-color: #1a89171a;">All jobs need some sort of qualifications to work at that
                <br> specific job. As a programmer, the person may not go very far if they only have a high school
                 degree. Most employers require programmers to have at least <br>a bachelor‚Äôs degree 
                 (Education Portal). Some higher-ranking jobs may even require a master‚Äôs degree (Education Portal).
                  Some qualifications may be as simple as<br>
 having a certain amount of experience (Education Portal).</em>
 <br>
 <br> With an advanced degree and certain knowledge,  a programmer could become a software engineer
  (Education Portal)><br>
  Certain employers and jobs may want the programmer to have great technical skills, and programming needs
   in the businesses (Education Portal).<br><br>

            The story of love
        </h2>
        <p>
            Love is a powerful emotion. Throughout history couples in love have caused wars and controversy,
             created masterpieces in writing, music, and art,<br>
              have captured the hearts of the public with the power of their bonds. From the allure of Cleopatra
               to the magnetism of the Kennedy's, these love affairs have stood<br>
                as markers in history. Prepare to swoon over these love stories of the centuries.
